1 Overview
**********

"wisi" used to be an acronym, but now it's just a name.

   The wisi package provides an elisp interface to an external parser.
It assumes the parser generator package WisiToken
(<http://stephe-leake.org/ada/wisitoken.html>, implemented in Ada), but
can use any parser that meets the same API. wisi provides several
grammar actions, to implement indentation, navigating, and syntax
highlighting (fontification).

   wisi also provides an extension to Emacs 'project.el', providing
operations useful for compilation and cross-reference.

2 Grammar Actions
*****************

Grammar actions are specified in the grammar file, in a nonterminal
declaration.  We assume the user is familiar with parser grammars and
grammar actions.  For example, a simple "if" statement can be declared
as:

     if_statement
       : IF expression THEN statements elsif_list ELSE statements END IF SEMICOLON
         %((wisi-statement-action [1 statement-start 3 motion 6 motion 10 statement-end])
           (wisi-motion-action [1 3 5 6 10])
           (wisi-indent-action [nil
                                [(wisi-hanging% ada-indent-broken (* 2 ada-indent-broken))
                                 ada-indent-broken]
                                nil
                                [ada-indent ada-indent] nil nil
                                [ada-indent ada-indent] nil nil nil]))%

   The item before ':' is the "left hand side", or "nonterminal".  The
list of tokens after ':' is the "right hand side"; in general there can
be more than one right hand side for each nonterminal (separated by
'|').

   The items enclosed in "%()%" are the grammar actions.  They are
specified as list of elisp forms; an earlier version of the wisi package
generated an elisp parser.  We keep the elisp form because it is
compact, and easier to read and write than the equivalent Ada code.  The
'wisi-bnf-generate' tool converts the elisp into the required Ada
statements.

   There are two classes of actions; in-parse and post-parse.  WisiToken
calls these "semantic checks" and "user actions".  The in-parse actions
are done as parsing procedes; they provide extra checks that can cause
the parse to fail.  Currently the only one provided is 'match-names'; it
is used to check that the declaration and end names in named Ada blocks
are the same (which can aid significantly in error correction).  In the
grammar file, in-parse actions are specified in a second '%()%' block,
which can be omitted if empty.  In this document, the term "action"
means "post-parse action", we use "in-parse action" unless the meaning
is clear from context.

   Executing the wisi grammar actions creates text properties in the
source file; those text properties are then used by elisp code for
various purposes.

   The text properties applied are:

'wisi-cache'
     This should be named 'wisi-navigate', but isn't for historical
     reasons (there used to be only one kind of text property).

     The property contains a 'wisi-cache' object, containing:

     'nonterm'
          The nonterminal in the grammar production that specified the
          action that produced this text property.

     'token'
          A token identifier naming a token in the production right hand
          side containing the text this text property is applied to.

     'last'
          The position of the last character in the token, relative to
          the first character (0 indexed).  The text property is only
          applied to the first character in the token (mostly for
          historical reasons).

     'class'
          A token class; see the list of possible values in
          'wisi-statement-action' below.

     'containing'
          A marker pointing to the start of the containing token for
          this token; only 'nil' for the outermost containing token in a
          file.

     'prev'
          A marker pointing to the previous "motion token" in the
          statement or declaration.  These are normally language
          keywords, but can be other things.

     'next'
          A marker pointing to the next "motion token" in the statement
          or declaration.

     'end'
          A marker pointing to the end of the statement or declaration.

     wisi provides motion commands for going to the various markers.

'wisi-name'
     Contains no data, applied to a "name" of some sort.  wisi provides
     commands for finding the next/previous name, and returning the
     text.  Useful for the names of subprograms, which can then be used
     to build a completion table; see
     'wisi-xref-identifier-completion-table'.

'font-lock-face'
     The standard font-lock property, specifying the face for the text.

     Some major modes do not use this for simple keywords; they use
     font-lock regular expressions instead.  One reason for this is so
     keywords are still highlighted when the parser fails, which can
     happen if there are severe syntax errors.

     Other items, like function and package names, are typically marked
     with 'font-lock-face' by the parser.

'fontified'
     Another standard font-lock text property; applied whenever
     'font-lock-face' is.

'wisi-indent'
     Contains the indent (in characters) for the next line; applied to
     the newline character on the preceding line.  The first line in a
     buffer is assumed to have indent 0.

   Each action is classified as one of 'navigate, face, indent,
in-parse'; when actions are executed, only one of the first three
classes is executed (in-parse is always executed).  This reflects the
reasons the parser is run; to figure out how to go somehere (end of
current statement, start of current procedure, etc), to apply faces for
syntax highlighting, or to indent the code.

File: wisi.info,  Node: Navigate actions,  Next: Face actions,  Up: Grammar actions

2.1 Navigate actions
====================

'wisi-statement-action [TOKEN CLASS ...]'
     The argument is a vector; alternating items are a token index (an
     integer or label indicating a token in the right hand side) and a
     "token class"; one of:

     'motion'
          Create a 'wisi-cache' text property on the token, for use in a
          subsequent 'wisi-motion-action'.

     'statement-end'
          Create a 'wisi-cache' text property on the token, enter a
          pointer to it in the other 'wisi-cache' objects in the
          statement or declaration.

     'statement-start'
          Create a 'wisi-cache' text property on the token, enter a
          pointer to it in the other 'wisi-cache' objects (in the
          'containing' slot) in the statement or declaration.

     'statement-override'
          Same as 'statement-start'; marks the token to be used as the
          statement start if the first token is optional.

     'misc'
          Create a 'wisi-cache' text property on the token, to be used
          for some other purpose.  It is good style to indicate the
          purpose in a comment.

          For example, ada-mode uses a 'misc' property on left
          parentheses that start a subprogram parameter list; this
          distinquishes them from other left parentheses, and makes it
          possible to automatically call 'ada-format-paramlist' to
          format the parameter list, instead of using the standard Emacs
          'align'.

'wisi-motion-action [TOKEN ...]'
     The argument is a vector, where each element is either a token
     index or a vector [INDEX ID].

     Each terminal token must already have a 'wisi-cache' created by a
     'wisi-statement-action' (this is checked at action execution, not
     during grammar generation).  This action sets the 'prev, next'
     slots for the chain of tokens, creating a chain of motion tokens.

     If TOKEN is a nonterminal without an ID specified, the 'wisi-cache'
     must be on the first token in the nonterminal, and it is assumed to
     have a valid pointer in the 'next' slot, indicating a chain of
     motion tokens.  That chain is linked into the chain for the current
     right hand side.

     If TOKEN is a nonterminal with an ID, the region contained by the
     nonterminal is searched for all 'wisi-cache' with that token ID,
     and for each one where prev/next is not already set, it is linked
     into the motion chain.

     Note that the "search" described here is done in the parser
     process, on a tree data structure containing the data that will
     eventually be stored in Emacs text properties.

'wisi-name-action TOKEN'
     TOKEN is a token index.  Create a 'wisi-name' text property on the
     token.


File: wisi.info,  Node: Face actions,  Next: Indent actions,  Prev: Navigate actions,  Up: Grammar actions

2.2 Face actions
================

'wisi-face-mark-action [INDEX CLASS ...]'
     The argument is a vector; alternating elements form pairs of INDEX
     CLASS, where class is one of 'prefix, suffix'.

     Mark the tokens as part of a compound name, for use by later face
     actions.

'wisi-face-apply-action [TOKEN PREFIX-FACE SUFFIX-FACE ...]'
     The argument is a vector; triples of items specify TOKEN,
     PREFIX-FACE, SUFFIX-FACE. The faces are the elisp names of face
     objects (which must declared by an '%elisp_face' declaration).

     If the token is a nonterminal, and it has been marked by a previous
     'wisi-face-mark-action', the specified faces are applied to the
     prefix and suffix in the token as 'font-lock-face' text properties.

     If the token is a terminal, or a non-terminal with no face mark,
     the suffix face is applied to the entire text contained by the
     token.

'wisi-face-apply-list-action [TOKEN PREFIX-FACE SUFFIX-FACE ...]'
     Similar to ’wisi-face-apply-action’, but applies faces to all
     tokens marked by 'wisi-face-mark-action' in each indicated
     production token, and does not apply a face if there are no such
     marks.

2.3 Indent actions
==================

Indents are computed for each line in a cumulative way as the grammar
actions are executed.  Initially, each indent is set to 'nil', which
means "not computed"; this is not the same as the value '0'.  The
grammar actions are executed in a bottom-up fashion; low level
productions are executed before higher level ones.  In general, the
indent action for a production specifies a "delta indent"; the indent is
incremented by that amount.  When all productions have been processed,
the indent has been computed for all lines.

   Indents are often given as a function call; the arguments to the
function can be other function calls, or integer expressions.
'wisitoken-bnf-generate' supports only simple integer expressions; those
using integers, integer-valued variables, parenthesis, + (plus), -
(minus), and * (multiply).

'wisi-indent-action [INDENT ...]'
     The argument is a vector, giving an indent for each token in the
     production right-hand side.

     For terminals, the indents only have meaning, and are only
     computed, if the token is the first on a line.  For nonterminals
     where the indent is not a variant of 'wisi-hanging', the indent is
     only computed if the first terminal token in the nonterminal is the
     first on a line.  See 'wisi-hanging' in *note Indent functions::
     for the remaining case.

     An indent can have several forms.  In the descriptions below, the
     "current token" is given by the position of the indent expression
     in the 'wisi-indent-action' argument list.

     An integer
          This gives a delta indent; it is added to the total indent for
          the line.

     A variable name
          The name is translated to an Ada identifier by replacing "-"
          with "_", and applying 'Camel_Case'.  The translated name must
          identify a directly visible run-time Ada integer variable;
          this is checked at Ada compile time.  It provides an integer
          delta indent.

          For example, in Ada two indent variable names are 'ada-indent'
          and 'ada-indent-broken', giving the basic ident, and the
          continuation line indent.  They are runtime variables so
          different projects can specify them as part of a coding
          standard.

     A function call
          A function that computes a delta indent.  See *note Indent
          functions::.

     [CODE-INDENT , COMMENT-INDENT]
          A vector giving separate indents for code and comments.

          Normally, the indent for trailing comments (on lines with no
          code, after all code in the token) is given by the indent of
          the following token in the production.  When the current token
          is the last, or the following tokens may be empty, or the
          indent of the following token would be wrong for some reason
          (for example, it is a block end), the comment indent may be
          specified separately.  If it is not specified, and the indent
          from the next token is not available, the indent for the
          current token is used for code and comments.

          Comment lines that are not trailing are indented by
          CODE-INDENT.

     (label . INDENT)
          If token labels are used in a right hand side, they must be
          given explicitly in the indent arguments, using he lisp "cons"
          syntax.  Labels are normally only used with EBNF grammars,
          which expand into multiple right hand sides, with optional
          tokens simply left out.  Explicit labels on the indent
          arguments allow them to be left out as well.

2.3.1 Indent functions
----------------------

'wisi-anchored TOKEN OFFSET'
     Sets the indent for the current token to be OFFSET (an integer
     expression) from the start of TOKEN (a token index); the current
     token is "anchored to" TOKEN.

'wisi-anchored* TOKEN OFFSET'
     Sets the indent for the current token to be OFFSET from the start
     of TOKEN, but only if TOKEN is the first token on a line; otherwise
     no indent

'wisi-anchored*- TOKEN OFFSET'
     Sets the indent for the current token to be OFFSET from the start
     of TOKEN, but only if TOKEN is the first token on a line and the
     indent for the current token accumulated so far is nil.

'wisi-anchored% TOKEN OFFSET'
     If there is an opening parenthesis containing TOKEN in the line
     containing TOKEN, set the current indent to OFFSET from that
     parenthesis.  Otherwise, OFFSET gives an indent delta.

'wisi-anchored%- TOKEN OFFSET'
     Same as 'wisi-anchored%', but only if the current token accumulated
     indent is nil.

'wisi-hanging DELTA-1 DELTA-2'
     The current token is assumed to be a nonterminal.  If the text it
     contains spans multiple lines, use DELTA-1 for the first line,
     DELTA-2 for the rest.  If the current token is only on one line,
     use DELTA-1.

     DELTA-1 and DELTA-2 can be any IDENT expression, except a variant
     of 'wisi-hanging'.

'wisi-hanging% DELTA-1 DELTA-2'
     Similar to 'wisi-hanging'; if the first terminal token in the
     current nonterminal is the first token on the first line, use
     DELTA-1 for the first line and DELTA-2 for the rest.  Otherwise,
     use DELTA-1 for all lines.

'wisi-hanging%- DELTA-1 DELTA-2'
     Same as 'wisi-hanging%', except applied only if the current token
     accumulated indent is nil.

'Language-specific function'
     Language-specific indent functions are specified by an
     '%elisp_indent' declaration in the grammar file.  Each function
     specifies how many arguments it accepts; this is checked at action
     runtime, not during grammar generation.  Each argument is an INDENT
     as described above, or a token ID prefixed by ''' (to allow
     distinguishing token IDs from variable names).


File: wisi.info,  Node: Indent example,  Prev: Indent functions,  Up: Indent actions

2.3.2 Indent example
--------------------

The example 'if_statement' grammar nonterminal is:

     if_statement
       : IF expression THEN statements elsif_list ELSE statements END IF SEMICOLON
         %((wisi-indent-action [nil
                                [(wisi-hanging% ada-indent-broken (* 2 ada-indent-broken))
                                 ada-indent-broken]
                                nil
                                [ada-indent ada-indent] nil nil
                                [ada-indent ada-indent] nil nil nil]))%

   We trace how the indent is computed for this sample Ada code:

      1: if A < B and
      2:   C < D
      3:   --  comment on expression
      4: then
      5:    if E then
      6:       Do_E;
      7:       -- comment on statement
      8:    elsif F then
      9:       G := A + Compute_Something
     10:         (arg_1, arg_2);
     11:    end if;
     12: end if;

   First, the indent for the lower-level nonterminals ('expression,
statements, elsif_list') are computed.  Assume they set the indent for
line 10 to 2 (for the hanging expression) and leave the rest at nil.

   Next, the action for the inner 'if_statement' is executed.  Most of
the tokens specify an indent of 'nil', which means the current
accumulated indent is not changed.  For the others, the action is as
follows:

'expression:'
     The expression 'E' is contained on one line, and it is not the
     first token on that line, so the indent for line 5 is not changed.

'statements: [ada-indent ada-indent]'
     This specifies separate indents for code and trailing comments,
     because otherwise the trailing comments would be indented with the
     following 'THEN'; instead they are indented with the expression
     code; see the comment on line 7.

     Here 'ada-indent' is 3, so the indent for lines 6 and 7 (for the
     first occurence of 'statments') is incremented from 'nil' to '3'.

     For the second occurence of 'statements', line 9 is incremented
     from 'nil' to '3', and line 10 from '2' to '5'.

   At this point, the accumulated indents are (the indent is given after
the line number):
      1: nil : if A < B and
      2: nil :   C < D
      3: nil :   --  comment on expression
      4: nil : then
      5: nil :    if E then
      6:   3 :       Do_E;
      7:   3 :       -- comment on statement
      8: nil :    elsif F then
      9:   3 :       G := A + Compute_Something
     10:   5 :         (arg_1, arg_2);
     11: nil :    end if;
     12: nil : end if;

   Then the action is executed for the outer 'if_statement':

'expression: [(wisi-hanging% ada-indent-broken (* 2 ada-indent-broken)) ada-indent-broken]'
     This specifies separate indents for code and trailing comments,
     because otherwise the trailing comments would be indented with the
     following 'THEN'; instead they are indented with the expression
     code; see the comment on line 3.

     In this case, 'wisi-hanging%' returns DELTA-1, which is
     'ada-indent-broken', which is 2.  So the indent for line 2 is
     incremented from 'nil' to '2'.

     The indent for line 3 is also incremented from 'nil' to '2'.

'statements: [ada-indent ada-indent]'
     Here there is only one statement; the nested 'if_statement'.  The
     indent for lines 5 ..  11 are each incremented by 3.

   The final result is:
      1: nil : if A < B and
      2:   2 :   C < D
      3:   2 :   --  comment on expression
      4: nil : then
      5:   3 :    if E then
      6:   6 :       Do_E;
      7:   6 :       -- comment on statement
      8:   3 :    elsif F then
      9:   6 :       G := A + Compute_Something
     10:   8 :         (arg_1, arg_2);
     11:   6 :    end if;
     12: nil : end if;

   In a full grammar, the top production should specify an indent of 0,
not nil, for tokens that are not indented; then every line will have a
non-nil indent.  However, in normal operation a nil indent is treated as
0; the 'wisi-indent' text property is not set for lines that have nil
indent, and 'wisi-indent-region' detects that and uses 0 for the indent.
You can set the variable 'wisi-debug' to a value > 0 to signal an error
for nil indents; this is useful to catch indent errors during grammar
development.

2.4 In-parse actions
====================

'wisi-propagate-name TOKEN'
     The argument is a token index.  Set the 'name' component of the
     left-hand-side parse-time token object to the 'name' component of
     the identified token, if it is not empty.  Otherwise use the
     'byte_region' component.

'wisi-merge-name FIRST-TOKEN, LAST-TOKEN'
     The arguments are token indices, giving a range of tokens.
     LAST-TOKEN may be omitted if it is the same as FIRST-TOKEN.

     Set the 'name' component of the left-hand-side to the merger of the
     'name' or 'byte-region' components of the identified tokens.

'wisi-match-name START-TOKEN END-TOKEN'
     The arguments are token indices.  Compare the text contained by the
     'name' (or 'byte_region' if 'name' is empty) token components for
     START-TOKEN and END-TOKEN; signal a parse error if they are
     different.

     The behavior when a name is missing is determined by the runtime
     language variable given in the '%end_names_optional_option'
     declaration; if True, a missing name that is supposed to match a
     present name is an error.  Both names missing is not an error
     (assuming that is allowed by the grammar).

3.1 Project files
=================

Project file names must have an extension given by
'wisi-prj-file-extensions' (default '.adp, .prj').

   Project files have a simple syntax; they may be edited directly.
Each line specifies a project variable name and its value, separated by
"=":

     src_dir=/Projects/my_project/src_1
     src_dir=/Projects/my_project/src_2

   There must be no space between the variable name and "=", and no
trailing spaces after the value.

   Any line that does not have an "=" is a comment.

   Some variables (like 'src_dir') are lists; each line in the project
file specifies one element of the list.  The value on the last line is
the last element in the list.

   A variable name that starts with '$' is set as a process environment
variable, for processes launched from Emacs for the project.

   In values, process environment variables can be referenced using the
normal '$var' syntax.

   In values, relative file names are expanded relative to the directory
containing the project file.

   Here is the list of project variables defined by wisi; major modes
may add more.

'casing' [slot: 'case-exception-files']
     List of files containing casing exceptions.  *Note Casing exception
     files::.

'src_dir' [slot: 'source-path']
     A list of directories to search for source files.

3.2 Selecting projects
======================

The current project can either be indicated by a global variable (called
a "selected project"), or depend on the current buffer.

   In addition, the project file can be parsed each time it is needed,
or the result cached to improve response time,

   One reason to use a selected project is to handle a hierarchy of
projects; if projects B and C both depend on library project A, then
when in a file of project A, there is no way to determine which of the
three projects to return.  So the user must indicate which is active, by
using one of 'wisi-prj-select-file' or 'wisi-prj-select-cache'.

   In addition, if changing from one project to another requires setting
global resources that must also be unset (such as a syntax propertize
hook or compilation filter hook), then the project should define
'wisi-prj-deselect' in addition to 'wisi-prj-select'.  Such projects
require having a selected current project, so it can be deselected
before a new one is selected.  One example of such projects is ada-mode.

   One way to declare each project is to add a Local Variables section
in the main Makefile for the project; when the Makefile is first
visited, the project is declared.  In the examples here, we assume that
approach is used; each gives an :eval line.

   Note that 'wisi-prj-current-parse' and 'wisi-prj-current-cached'
always succeed after some project is selected; no functions after them
on 'project-find-functions' will be called.  That's why the depth is 90
for those in the examples.

No caching, current project depends on current buffer

          (add-hook 'project-find-functions #'wisi-prj-find-dominating-parse 0)

          :eval (wisi-prj-set-dominating "foo.prj" (foo-prj-default "prj-name"))

     'wisi-prj-set-dominating' declares the name of a project file with
     a default project object, and ensures that the current buffer file
     name is in 'wisi-prj--dominating'.

     'wisi-prj-find-dominating-parse' looks for the filenames in
     'wisi-prj--dominiating' in the parent directories of the current
     buffer.  When one is found, the associated project file is parsed,
     using the default project object to dispatch to the appropriate
     parsers.  Then the final project object is returned.

Caching, current project depends on current buffer

          (add-hook 'project-find-functions #'wisi-prj-find-dominating-cached 0)

          :eval (wisi-prj-cache-dominating "foo.prj" (foo-prj-default "prj-name"))

     'wisi-prj-cache-dominating' declares the project file, parses it,
     and saves the project object in a cache indexed by the absolute
     project file name.

     'wisi-prj-find-dominating-cached' finds the dominating project
     file, and retrieves the object from the cache.

No caching, last selected project is current

          (add-hook 'project-find-functions #'wisi-prj-current-parse 90)

          :eval: (wisi-prj-select-file <prj-file> (foo-prj-default "prj-name"))

     'wisi-prj-select-file' sets the project file as the current
     project, and saves the default project object.

     'wisi-prj-current-parse' parses the current project file, using the
     saved default project object, and returns the project object.

Caching, last selected project is current

          (add-hook 'project-find-functions #'wisi-prj-current-cached 90)

          :eval: (wisi-prj-select-cache <prj-file> (foo-prj-default "prj-name"))

     'wisi-prj-select-cache' parses the project file, caches the project
     object.

     'wisi-prj-current-cached' returns the cached current project
     object.

   In addition, the user should set 'xref-backend-functions'.
Currently, there is only one choice for wisi projects:

     (add-to-list 'xref-backend-functions #'wisi-prj-xref-backend 90)

   'wisi-prj-xref-backend' returns the current wisi project object.

3.3 Casing exception files
==========================

Each line in a case exception file specifies the casing of one word or
word fragment.  If an exception is defined in multiple files, the first
occurrence is used.

   If the word starts with an asterisk ('*'), it defines the casing of a
word fragment (or "substring"); part of a word between two underscores
or word boundary.

   For example:

     DOD
     *IO
     GNAT

   The word fragment '*IO' applies to any word containing "_io";
'Text_IO', 'Hardware_IO', etc.


File: wisi.info,  Node: Other project functions,  Prev: Casing exception files,  Up: Project extension

3.4 Other project functions
===========================

'wisi-refresh-prj-cache (not-full)'
     Refreshes all cached data in the project, and re-selects the
     project.  If NOT-FULL is non-nil, slow refresh operations are
     skipped.

     This reparses the project file, and any cross reference
     information.

'wisi-prj-select-dominating (dominating-file)'
     Find a wisi-prj matching DOMINATING-FILE (defaults to the current
     buffer file).  If the associated project is current, do nothing.
     If it is not current, select it.

     This is useful before running 'compilation-start', to ensure the
     correct project is current.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
