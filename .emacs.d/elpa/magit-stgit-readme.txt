This package provides very basic support for StGit.

When `magit-stgit-mode' is turned on the current patch series is
displayed in the status buffer.  Additionally a few Emacs commands
are defined that wrap around StGit commands.  These commands are
also available as "section actions".

If you are looking for full fledged StGit support in Emacs, then
have a look at `stgit.el' which is distributed with StGit.
