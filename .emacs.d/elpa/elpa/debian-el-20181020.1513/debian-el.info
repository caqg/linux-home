The debian-el Package Setup
***************************

This manual describes the debian-el package and its setup.  A quick
descriptions of elisp files contained in this package can be found in
the file '/usr/share/doc/debian-el/README.Debian'.

   All packaged files are installed, setup and ready to use (they don't
override standard Emacs commands, modes, or settings).

   To customize setup of all customizable packages on a finer-grain
basis, do:
     M-x customize-group <RET> debian-el <RET>

1 apt-sources - Mode for editing apt sources.list files.
********************************************************

This mode is for editing '/etc/apt/sources.list' and
'/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list', the APT (Advanced Package Tool)
configuration files found on Debian systems.

   APT is a package retrieval tool for Debian; for example you could
install Emacs with the command:

       apt-get install emacs21

   and APT will then retrieve the package and install it for you.  The
sources.list file tells APT where to look for packages.  Mine looks like
this:

       deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
       deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main

       deb ftp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian ../project/experimental main

   This mode font-locks the file and add some things including new
source lines and modifying existing source lines.

   This mode can be customized in diferent parts.  You can
(interactively) change if you want blank lines around a new source line
and comment with 'apt-sources-around-lines'.  Also you can change the
way that this mode names each source line with the variable
'apt-sources-source-name'; if no name is entered, no comment name will
be inserted.

   You can modify existing parts of the source line; check the mode
documentation for more details.  Another thing that this mode can do is
to replicate an existing line ('C-c C-r') that will be changed to the
'deb' or 'deb-src' corresponding line.  If it replicates a 'deb' line,
an identical 'deb-src' source line will be created.

2 apt-utils - Emacs interface to APT
************************************

Start things off using e.g.:
     M-x apt-utils-show-package <RET> emacs21 <RET>

   Other packages (dependencies, conflicts etc) can be navigated using
'apt-utils-next-package' (<TAB>), 'apt-utils-prev-package' (<M-TAB>),
'apt-utils-choose-package-link' (<>>) or 'apt-utils-follow-link'
(<RET>).  Return to the previous package with
'apt-utils-view-previous-package' (<<>).

   ChangeLog and README files for the current package can easily be
accessed with, for example, 'apt-utils-view-changelog' (<C>).

   For normal (i.e., not virtual) packages, the information can be
toggled between 'package' and 'showpkg' displays using
'apt-utils-toggle-package-info' (<t>); the latter is useful for the
"Reverse Depends".

   View the key bindings with describe-mode (bound to ?  by default) or
use the menu.

   You may alter various settings of 'apt-utils' bu customizing the
group 'apt-utils'.

     Browse the BTS via 'browse-url' for the bug report number under
     point.

'debian-bug-web-this-bug-under-mouse'
     Browse the BTS via 'browse-url' for the bug report number under
     mouse.  (Normally bound to mouse-2 in some modes)

'debian-bug-get-bug-as-email'
     Read bug report #BUG-NUMBER via Email interface.

The command 'M-x debian-bug' prompts for required information to start
filling in the mail draft buffer.  It then allows you to edit these
fields in the mail draft buffer with a useful menu-bar and view help
text about your various options.  If the Debian package 'wget' is
installed, you may download the list of bugs for the affected package at
that time, and download the text of a specific bug number as well.

The debian-bug facility depends on the reportbug package.

4 deb-view - View Debian package archive files with tar-mode
************************************************************

Author: Rick Macdonald (rickm@vsl.com)

   deb-view presents the contents of debian package archive files for
viewing.  The viewing is done with the major mode "debview", which is
derived from emacs tar-mode with a few enhancements for viewing
compressed files, HTML files and formatted man pages.  The normal
editing and saving features of tar-mode are not supported by deb-view.

   deb-view includes a command called 'deb-find' which requires that you
have the debian distribution directories on a local or mounted
filesystem.  Give it a string or regular expression and it presents a
buffer of matching deb file names.  Click with the middle mouse button
or press <RETURN> (or <C-c C-c>) and it launches deb-view on the
selected file.  deb-find can be configured to use locate or find, or any
other external command.  The find method passes your search
specification to egrep, whereas the locate method uses your string
directly.

   deb-view extracts the control.tar.gz and data.tar.gz files from
debian package and presents two buffers in a derivitive of tar-mode.
See tar-mode for info.

Optionally required programs:
'nroff'
     for formatting man pages.
'w3-mode'
     for viewing HTML pages.

   *Note:* Since version 37.3, dpkg-deb is required.

* deb-view usage::

4.1 Configuration
=================

deb-view is mostly unobtrusive, but does bind <C-d> in dired to
'deb-view-dired-view'.  The "debview" mode is derived from tar-mode.el
using derived.el.  Compared to tar-mode, debview-mode binds <q>, <N>,
<W>, and re-binds <v>.  Also, the normal editing and saving features of
tar-mode are not supported by debview mode and those keys are disabled.

   'deb-find' has two variables to set.  'deb-find-method' can be
"locate" or "find".  Any other value will be assumed to be an external
script or program that you supply.  If you set 'deb-find-method' to
"find" then you must also set 'deb-find-directory' to the directory
containing the debian distribution.  The find command starts at this
point.  I originally used the locate option, but contrary to the man
page it doesn't seem to understand even simple regular expressions.  I
prefer the find option.  It uses egrep and therefore understands complex
regular expressions.  You might want to bind 'deb-find' to a special
key.  I use <C-d> like this:

  (define-key ctl-x-map "\C-d" 'deb-find)

   Note that this key is normally the brief 'list-directory' command, a
command that I never used anyway.


File: debian-el.info,  Node: deb-view usage,  Prev: deb-view configuration,  Up: deb-view

4.2 Usage
=========

In dired, press <f> or <e> on the dired line of the .deb file to view.
You can also use <C-d>, which is actually slightly faster since the deb
file isn't loaded into a buffer needlessly.

   Or, execute: 'M-x deb-view RETURN', and enter the .deb file name at
the prompt.

   Or, execute: 'M-x deb-find RETURN', and enter any substring of a deb
file name to search for.  A buffer of matches is created.  Launch
'deb-view' by selecting a deb file with the middle mouse button, or
<RETURN> or <C-c>.  Exit this buffer with <q>.

   You are shown two tar files in debview-mode (see tar-mode for help).
In the case of old .deb format files, the control info is shown but not
the other files of control.tar, such as install scripts.  Note that
regular tar-mode commands <e>, <f> and <RETURN> show raw files without
any special uncompressing or formatting.  Additional features that
deb-view adds to tar-mode:

'q'
     kill both view buffers (INFO and DATA) and return to the dired
     buffer if that's where you executed deb-mode.
'v'
     executes deb-view-tar-view instead of tar-view, with the additional
     smarts to uncompress .gz and .Z files for viewing.
'N'
     Like in dired, formats man pages for viewing, with the additional
     smarts to uncompress .gz and .Z man files for viewing.
'W'
     use w3-mode to view an HTML file.

   To view files not supported by deb-view, such as graphics, use the
copy command (<c>) to copy the file to a temp directory.  You can then
do what you want to the file.

5 gnus-BTS - access the Debian Bug Tracking System from Gnus
************************************************************

Use this if you read a lot of debian lists in GNUS and see references to
the Bug Tracking system in them.  It expects to see Bug references in
the form of (for example): "#48273", "closes: 238742" or similar and
will make them clickable.

   To enable this, add the following to your '~/.emacs' file:

     (require 'gnus-BTS)

6 preseed - major mode for debian-installer preseed files
*********************************************************

Author: W. Borgert <debacle@debian.org>

   A simple major-mode for editing debian-installer preseed files.
Since such files don't always have the same extension, this mode is not
autoloaded.  Enter it by using teh command line:

     M-x preseed-mode
