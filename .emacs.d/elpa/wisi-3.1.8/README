Emacs wisi package 3.1.2

The wisi package provides utilities for using generalized
error-correcting LR parsers (in external processes) to do indentation,
fontification, and navigation; and integration with Emacs package.el.
See ada-mode for an example of its use.

It also provides wisitoken-parse_table-mode, for navigating the
diagnostic parse tables output by wisitoken-bnf-generate.

The generated code is in Ada; it requires the AdaCore gnat compiler
that you may not have installed. It is available in many packaging
systems, or as a binary download from
https://www.adacore.com/download.
