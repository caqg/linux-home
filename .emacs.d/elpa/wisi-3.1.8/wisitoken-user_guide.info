1 Overview
**********

WisiToken is a parser runtime and generator toolkit, supporting
generalized LR (both LALR and LR1) and packrat parsers; the LR parser
provides robust error recovery and incremental parsing.  The grammar can
be expressed as either Ada source code statements, or in an EBNF file.
The parser generator generates Ada, either plain or assuming the Emacs
wisi package.

   At one point, "wisi" was short for "Wisent Indentation engine"; the
Emacs 'wisi' package implements an indentation engine that used to be
based on the Emacs wisent parser.  However, that parser has now been
replaced by the WisiToken parser, so "wisi" is just a name.

1.1 Install
===========

WisiToken is available as source code only, although a subset is
available in the GNU ELPA package 'wisi'.

   You will also need to install a lexer generator.  WisiToken supports
re2c, and other lexers can be added.

   re2c is available from <http://re2c.org/>; it is also packaged in
Mingw64 and Debian.  WisiToken requires at least version 1.3.  The
WisiToken makefile assumes the executable 're2c' is in '$PATH'.

2 Common grammar problems
*************************

LR grammars can be tricky.  Here we describe some common problems people
run into.

* Menu:

* Too many empty nonterms::


File: wisitoken-user_guide.info,  Node: Too many empty nonterms,  Up: Common grammar problems

2.1 Too many empty nonterms
===========================

If there are too many possibly empty nonterms in a right hand side,
incremental parse can get confused.

   For example, in the original grammar for Emacs wisitoken grammar
mode, a nonterminal declaration had the syntax:
     nonterminal : IDENTIFIER ':' rhs_list [';']
   where 'rhs_list' can be empty, because 'rhs' can be empty.  However,
suppose we have a declaration in our language grammar file:
     expression
       : IDENTIFIER
       | NUMBER
       ;
   and we want to insert an intermediate new nonterminal 'primary'.  So
we start typing:
     expression
       : primary
       : IDENTIFIER
       | NUMBER
       ;
   At this point, this is parsed as "nonterminal nonterminal", where the
'rhs_list' in the first nonterminal is empty, and the semicolon is
absent.  There is no syntax error.  Now we type ";":
     expression
       : primary
       ;
       : IDENTIFIER
       | NUMBER
       ;
   Emacs wisitoken grammar mode uses incremental parse; the first step
in parsing this is to edit the syntax tree to insert the new ";".  That
leaves the token stream "nonterminal IDENTIFIER SEMICOLON nonterminal",
which is a syntax error.

   One solution is to improve the edit step to delete the empty
nonterms, which would allow the parser to replace them with the intended
text.  However, the empty nonterms are not adjacent to the edit point;
they are before "primary", the edit point is after.  So this would
require deleting all empty nonterms in the entire tree, or guessing
about what range to delete.  The first option is not incremental, the
second will fail mysteriously on a minor change to a complex grammar.

   Instead, we improved the wisitoken grammar to avoid the empty
'rhs_list', since there is no point to one anyway:
     nonterminal : IDENTIFIER ':' rhs_list ['|'] [';']
   and 'rhs_list' cannot be empty.  Now incremental parse does not get
confused.

3 Grammar File Syntax
*********************

The grammar file syntax is based on Gnu bison syntax with some additions
and deletions (*note Bison: (bison)Top.).

   (The grammar is specified in the WisiToken grammar file
'wisitoken_grammar.wy').

   The top level file structure is a list of declarations and
nonterminals.

   Comments are started by ';;' and terminated by end of line.

3.1.1 Raw code
--------------

%code { actions | copyright_license } [spec | body | context | pre | post]... %{ <output language code> }%

   Raw code declarations contain arbitrary code, copied verbatim into
the output.  The keywords following '%code' determine where the section
is output.

   Sometimes the generator cannot tell what context clauses for other
packages are required in the actions package body; then you must use a
%code declaration to add them.

3.1.2 Keywords
--------------

%keyword <name> <string>

   example:
%keyword SEMICOLON ";"

   "Keywords" are reserved words or symbols in the target language; the
lexers recognize them by the given string.


File: wisitoken-user_guide.info,  Node: Tokens,  Next: Error recovery,  Prev: Keywords,  Up: Declarations

3.1.3 Tokens
------------

%token < kind > name regexp repair_image

   example:
%token <symbol> IDENTIFIER %[ ... ]% "A_Bogus_Identifier"
%token <punctuation> TICK "'"

   The syntax of the regular expression is determined by the lexer
generator.

   'repair_image' is used in error repair information; it should be
inserted by an editor at the place of the expected but missing token.

   The meaning of the following values of 'kind' are defined by the
WisiToken generator.  Other token kinds may be used for documentation;
they just declare a token name and regular expression.

'<string-double-one-line>'
     %token <string-double-one-line> STRING_LITERAL %[ ... ]%
     A string of characters that have string syntax, with double quote
     delimiters, may not contain a new-line.

     The regular expression is assumed to match such a string; this is
     not checked.

     The restriction of not containing a new-line allows improving
     incremental parse when inserting/deleting string quotes; the text
     is affected only thru the following new-line.  Without this
     restriction, when a string quote is inserted/deleted, the entire
     following text must be scanned by the lexer, and parsed.

     If an embedded quote is escaped by doubling it (as for Ada
     strings), include the declaration '%escape_delimiter_doubled
     <token_name>'.

'<string-single-one-line>'
     %token <string-single-one-line> CHARACTER_LITERAL %[ ... ]%
     A string of characters that have string syntax, with single quote
     delimiters, may not contain a new-line.

     The regular expression is assumed to match such a string; this is
     not checked.

'<string-double>'
     %token <string-double> STRING_LITERAL %[ ... ]%
     A string of characters that have string syntax, with double quote
     delimiters, may contain a newline.

     The regular expression is assumed to match such a string; this is
     not checked.

'<string-single>'
     %token <string-single> CHARACTER_LITERAL %[ ... ]%
     A string of characters that have string syntax, with single quote
     delimiters, may contain a newline.

     The regular expression is assumed to match such a string; this is
     not checked.

'<new-line>'
     %token <new-line> NEW_LINE
     Declares the non-grammar new-line token, used to count lines.  It
     has no regexp argument; DOS and Unix line endings are added
     internally.  This must be declared if line information is desired.

     For backward compatibility with previous WisiToken versions, any
     regexp present is ignored.

'<comment-new-line>'
     %token <comment-new-line> COMMENT "--"
     Declares a non-grammar comment token that is terminated by a line
     end or end of input.  The string argument must match only the
     comment start (the example shows the Ada comment start); DOS and
     Unix line endings, and end of input, are added internally.  The
     token includes the line end; no separate new-line token is produced
     after the comment token.

'<comment-one-line>'
     %token <comment-one-line> PLACEHOLDER "{" "}"
     Declares a non-grammar comment token that is terminated by the end
     delimiter, may not contain a new-line.  The two arguments are
     strings, and must match only the comment start and end (the example
     shows a template placeholder); DOS and Unix line endings, and end
     of input, are added internally.  The delimiters must be different;
     this is checked at grammar generation time.

     Does not handle nested delimiters; the token is terminated by the
     first end delimiter.

'<delimited-text>'
     %token <delimited-text> RAW_CODE "%{" "}%"
     A token that contains arbitrary text (including new-line),
     delimited by the two strings.  The arguments provide the comment
     start and end - the rest of the regular expression is provided by
     the generator.  The delimiters must be different; this is checked
     at grammar generation time.

     Does not handle nested delimiters; the token is terminated by the
     first end delimiter.

'<non-reporting>'
     %token <non-reporting> WHITESPACE %[ [ \t] ]%
     A token that is recognized by the lexer, but not returned to the
     parser.

3.1.4 Error recovery
--------------------

The parser uses an error recovery algorithm when it encounters a syntax
error; if a solution is found, the parse continues.

   Several grammar file declarations set parameters for the error
recovery.  If none of these parameters are present in the grammar file,
the generated parser does not do error recovery.

   The error recovery algorithm generates possible solutions based on
the parse state preceding the error point, by inserting, deleting, or
pushing back tokens.  Each possible solution is given a cost, and
enqueued to be checked later.  Solutions are checked in cost order
(lowest first).

'%no_error_recover'
     States that there is no error recovery for this parser.  This is
     the default if no error recover parameters are specified.

'%mckenzie_check_limit <limit>'
     The number of tokens past the error point that must be parsed
     successfully for a solution to be deemed successful.  Smaller
     values give faster recovery; larger values give better solutions.
     Too large a value risks encountering another user error, making a
     solution impossible.  3 or 4 works well in practice; default is 4.

'mckenzie_check_delta_limit <limit>'
     When error recovery is entered with multiple parsers active, once a
     solution has been found for one parser, the other parsers are
     allowed to check only 'mckenzie_check_delta_limit' possible
     solutions before they fail.  This prevents long recovery times.

'%mckenzie_zombie_limit <limit>'
     When a parser encounters an error, it is not terminated
     immediately; it becomes a zombie.  The other parsers must advance
     zombie limit tokens past the error point without error before the
     zombie is terminated.

     Smaller values give faster parsing, because parallel parsers are
     terminated sooner; in particular, in a language with conflicts that
     occur often, a small value gives the generalized parser a chance to
     get down to 1 parser, which is a significant gain in speed.

     Larger values give better error solutions, because they may include
     the original intended code.  For example, consider the following
     Ada code:
          procedure Pattern_1 is new Ada.Containers.Indefinite_Doubly_Linked_Lists (Pattern);
          procedure Pattern_2 is Ada : Integer; begin null; end;
     Pattern_1 is a generic instantiation; Pattern_2 is a procedure
     body.  There is a grammar conflict on "is", so a second parser is
     spawned there, with one expecting to see a generic instantiation,
     the other a procedure body.  If the "new" is missing, the generic
     instantiation parser errors on "Ada", but the procedure body parser
     doesn't error until "."  (a variable declaration cannot have "."
     in the name).  If 'mckenzie_zombie_limit' is 1, the generic
     instantiation parser is terminated before error recover is started,
     so the correct solution (insert "new") is not found.

     Setting 'mckenzie_zombie_limit' the same as 'mckenzie_check_limit'
     works well in practice, unless it needs to be smaller; default is
     4.

'%mckenzie_cost_default <insert> <delete> <push back> <ignore check fail>'
     McKenzie error recovery default costs for insert, delete, push back
     single tokens, and for ignoring a semantic check failure; four
     floating point numbers.

     "Push back" means undo parsing; remove tokens from the parse stack
     and put them back into the input stream.  This moves the
     insert/delete point, allowing better solutions.  The push back
     default cost is also the undo reduce default cost.

     If not specified, costs are zero.  Costs can be negative; they all
     add linearly.

'%mckenzie_cost_delete <token> <cost>'
     McKenzie error recovery delete cost for a specific token.

'%mckenzie_cost_fast_forward <cost>'
     McKenzie error recovery cost for parsing ahead after fixing one
     error, moving to the next error location.

'%mckenzie_cost_insert <token> <cost>'
     McKenzie error recovery insert cost for a specific token.

'%mckenzie_cost_fast_forward <cost>'
     McKenzie error recovery cost for using the 'matching_begin'
     strategy.

'%mckenzie_cost_push_back <token> <cost>'
     McKenzie error recovery push back cost for a specific token.

'%mckenzie_cost_undo_reduce <token> <cost>'
     McKenzie error recovery undo reduce cost for a specific token.

'%mckenzie_enqueue_limit <integer>'
     McKenzie error recovery limit on possible solutions enqueued (to be
     checked); default max integer.

'%mckenzie_minimal_complete_cost_delta <cost>'
     McKenzie error recovery cost added to the cost of an inserted token
     when the insert is done by the minimal complete strategy; this cost
     is normally negative.

3.1.5 Other declarations
------------------------

'%case_insensitive'
     If present, keywords are case insensitive in the lexer.

'%conflict <conflict description>'
     Declare a known conflict.

     Example conflict declaration:
     %conflict REDUCE abstract_limited_opt | REDUCE abstract_limited_synchronized_opt on token NEW

     The conflict description is output by 'wisitoken-bnf-generate' when
     an undeclared conflict is detected.  If the user decides to not fix
     the conflict, the description can be copied into the grammar source
     file, so it will be ignored next time around.  Or it can be
     converted to a '%conflict_resolution'; see the next item.

     If a conflict has more than two branches, it must be declared more
     than once, first with two branches, then with one more, etc.  This
     is due to the way conflicts are found during the parse table
     generation process.

     Resolving conflicts in the grammar can be difficult, but leaving
     them in can increase parse time and cause ambiguous parses.

     In Emacs, 'wisitoken-parse_table-mode' provides a command
     'wisitoken-parse_table-conflict-goto' that will find a conflict in
     the parse table file, which has more information that might help
     resolve the conflict.  'wisitoken-grammar-mode' binds that command
     to <^c .>.

'%conflict_resolution <conflict description> : <resolution>'
     Declare a conflict resolution.  The conflict description is the
     same as in a '%conflict' declaration; the resolution says which
     branch of the conflict to take.

     Only one kind of resolution is supported: a token name, which must
     match one of the token names in the conflict description; the
     branch that contains that token is taken.

     Example conflict resolution declaration:
     %conflict REDUCE abstract_limited_opt
      | REDUCE abstract_limited_synchronized_opt on token NEW
      : abstract_limited_opt
     This says to always reduce to 'abstract_limited_opt'.

'%elisp_face <name>'
     Declare a name for an elisp face constant.

     When generating Ada code for Emacs, the elisp faces applied by
     'wisi-face-apply' actions must be declared, so the elisp and Ada
     code aggree on what they mean.

'%elisp_indent <elisp name> <Ada name> [<arg_count> [token_arg_index]...]'
     Declare elisp and Ada names for an indent variable or function.

     When generating Ada code for Emacs, names used in 'wisi-indent'
     actions that are not recognized are assumed to be elisp and Ada
     variables, with the Ada name derived from elisp name by replacing
     '-' with '_', and converting to 'Mixed_Case'.

     Indent variables that don't meet that naming convention must be
     declared, so the elisp and Ada code agree on what they mean.

     Custom indent functions are implemented in Ada; the 'elisp name' is
     the name used in grammar file actions.  The declaration includes
     the argument count and which arguments are token indicies.  Token
     index arguments are converted to token labels if automatic labeling
     is in effect.

     For example, Ada declares:
     %elisp_indent "ada-indent-record*" Ada_Indent_Record_1  3 1 2
     The name used in grammar file actions is 'ada-indent-record*'.  The
     Ada function name is 'Ada_Indent_Record_1'; it must be visible in
     the generated code body, either by being declared in the language
     runtime package spec, or in a package made use-visible by a
     use-clause in a '%code' block.  It takes three arguments; the first
     two are token indices.

'%elisp_action <elisp name> <Ada name>'
     Declare elisp and Ada names for a custom action subprogram written
     in Ada.

     The elisp name is used in grammar actions.

     Note that custom Ada functions can also be declared by
     '%elisp_indent'; those must appear as an argument to a
     'wisi-indent-action' grammar action; 'elisp_action' are grammar
     actions.

'%end_names_optional_option <name>'
     When generating Ada code for Emacs, the name of the Ada variable
     determining whether end block names are optional.

     In the Ada language, block names can be repeated at the end; for
     example:

     Get_Inputs :
     loop
     ...
     end loop Get_Inputs;

     These names are optional in the Ada standard.  Making them required
     improves error recovery; the recovery algorithm can use matching
     names to isolate the error.

'%escape_delimiter_doubled <token_name>'
     The named token escapes embedded delimiters by doubling them, as
     for Ada strings.  This is used by incremental parse when editing
     such tokens.

'%generate <generate_algorithm> <output_language>'

     '<generate_algorithm>' is one of 'LALR | LR1 | Packrat_Gen |
     Packrat_Proc | External | Tree_Sitter'.

     '<output_language>' is one of 'Ada | Ada_Emacs'.

     The algorithm/output_language pair declares one output source set.
     Multiple sets can be declared; they are all generated together.

     More detail on 'generate_algorithm':
     'LALR | LR1'
          Generates a parse table using the LALR or LR1 algorithms (see
          'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser').  At runtime, an
          error correcting generalized LR parser uses the parse table to
          parse the input text.

          An additional generate parameter 'text_rep' determines how the
          parse table is represented; if present, it is in a text file
          that is loaded at parser run time.  If absent, it is in the
          code.  For very large parse tables, such as for an LR1 parser
          for a large language like Ada, the text representation may be
          needed, because the Ada compiler can't handle the very large
          number of statements that represent the parser table in the
          code.  The text file can take a long time to read at parser
          startup (a few seconds for the Ada language).

     'Packrat_Gen'
          Generates Ada code that implements a packrat parser.  Left
          recursive grammar productions are not supported.  See
          'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar'.

     'Packrat_Proc'
          Generates Ada code that interprets the grammar using a packrat
          parser.  Left recursive grammar productions are not supported.
          See
          'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar'.

          This uses the same parsing algorithm as 'Packrat_Gen'; it is
          slower, but easier to debug.

     'External'
          Generates code that implements the grammar actions only, for
          use with a parser that is generated by an external program.

     'Tree_Sitter'
          Translates the grammar file to a tree-sitter grammar file, and
          generates code that impements the grammar actions.

     '<output_language>' determines both what code is generated, and
     what language is used for the grammar actions.  For 'Ada', the
     grammar action language is Ada, and it is copied verbatim into the
     generated grammar action code.  For 'Emacs_Ada', the grammar action
     language is elisp, which is translated to Ada by assuming it will
     be used by the GNU ELPA package 'wisi' (see
     'https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/wisi.html').

     When the output language is emacs_ada, an additional parameter is
     required: 'Process | Module'.  For 'Process', the generated code
     runs in an Emacs background process.  For 'Module', the generated
     code runs as an Emacs loadable module (currently not supported).

'%language_runtime <string>'
     Specify an alternate name for the language runtime package; the
     default is 'Wisi.<language_name>', where '<language_name>' is the
     simple name of the language grammar file, without the file
     extension.  The value must be enclosed in quotes.

'%lr1_hash_table_size <integer>'
     Specify the size of the hash table used when generating an LR1
     parse table.  The default size is 113; larger size can decrease
     generate time on larger languages, but only by 10%.  A prime larger
     than the requested size is used.

'%max_parallel <integer>'
     Maximum number of parallel parsers during main parsing.  Default is
     15; a language with many conflicts may need more.

'%meta_syntax [BNF | EBNF]'
     Declares the syntax used by the grammar file.  BNF is a minor
     extension of standard Backus Naur Form; EBNF is a large extension.
     The default is BNF.

'%no_enum'
     By default, the generated Ada code includes an enumeration type
     declaring each token.  This makes the language-specific runtime
     easier to write (without this type, tokens are identified by
     integers).

     '%no_enum' causes the generated code to not include the token
     enumeration type.

'%no_language_runtime'
     When generating Ada code for Emacs, '%no_language_runtime' causes
     the generated code to not include the runtime.  Some grammars may
     need no runtime, particularly if they are small grammars intendend
     to test some generator feature.

'%partial_recursion'
     The error recovery algorithm requires computing the recursion
     present in the language grammar.  For some grammars (such as Java),
     this is too hard; '%partial_recursion' tells WisiToken to use a
     simpler approximate calculation.  This will affect the quality of
     the error recovery, but it will still be robust.

'%start <nontermininal>'
     The start token for the grammar.

'%suppress <nontermininal> <warning label>'
     Suppress the indicated warning for the nonterminal.

     '<warning label>' is a copy of part of the text of the warning
     message.  The supported warnings are:
        * may never match; it shares a prefix

'%lexer_regexp <name> <value>'
     Declare a named regular expression with name and current lexer
     syntax.  The name may then occur in another lexer regular
     expression.

A nonterminal statement declares a nonterminal token, and the associated
production rules and actions.

   The syntax of a nonterminal statement is:

nonterminal : rhs {| rhs} ;
   A nonterminal is defined by a list of alternate right hand sides.

rhs : {rhs_item} [action [action]] ;
   Each right hand side is a list of items, followed by zero to two
actions; the first is the post-parse action, the second the in-parse
action.

   In-parse actions are exeuted during the parse, when the production is
reduced; they can add semantic checks that help during error recovery.

   Post-parse actions are executed after the parse is complete, when a
node produced by this production is visited during the tree traversal;
they typically build an abstract syntax tree.

   The actions are written in output-language code; for 'Ada_Emacs'
output, this is elisp (a hold-over from when WisiToken only output elisp
code).

   If using BNF, the syntax of an rhs_item is:
rhs_item : token ;
   Where 'token' is defined by a token declaration.

   if using EBNF:
rhs_item
  : token
  | < identifier = identifier >
  | rhs_optional_item
  | rhs_multiple_item
  | '(' rhs {| rhs} ')'
  ;
   Here 'token' is either defined by a token declaration, or the token
value contained in single quotes.

   The second option is an attribute, as defined by ANTLR; these are
ignored in wisitoken.

   Parentheses are used to group items.

rhs_optional_item
  : '[' rhs {| rhs} ']'
  | '(' rhs {| rhs} ')' '?'
  | token '?'
  ;
   These options all mean the same thing; the content is present zero or
one times.

rhs_multiple_item
  : '{' rhs {| rhs} '}'
  | '{' rhs {| rhs} '}-'
  | '(' rhs {| rhs} ')+'
  | '(' rhs {| rhs} ')*'
  | token '+'
  | token '*'
  ;
   "{}", "()*", and "token*" mean the content is present zero or more
times.  "{}-", "()+", and "token+" mean the content is present one or
more times.

3.3 Conditional code
====================

It is sometimes necessary to include or exclude some declarations and
portions of rules based on the choice of lexer or parser.

   Therefore WisiToken supports '%if ... %elsif ... %end if' in the
grammar file:
%if {lexer | parser} = {<lexer> | <generate_algorithm>}
...
%elsif {lexer | parser} = {<lexer> | <generate_algorithm>}
...
%end if

   The lines between '%if, %elsif' and '%end if' are ignored if the
current lexer or parser is not the one specified in the '%if, %elsif'
condition.

   '%if ... %end if' cannot be nested.

3.4 Optimized lists
===================

A list of tokens is often specified as:
     declarations
       : declaration
       | declarations declaration
       ;
   If the input syntax consists of a single long list of declarations,
the resulting syntax tree is a linear list at the top level.  This
causes performance problems in incremental parse; editing the syntax
tree requires breaking down then entire list, taking time proportional
to the input text length.

   This is improved by recognizing the following construct:
     declarations
       : declaration
       | declarations declaration
       | declarations declarations
       ;
   This is called an "optimized list".  It has conflicts, which are
resolved by choosing to reduce to declarations; they do not need to be
declared in the grammar file.  In a batch parse, this produces the same
syntax tree as the first definition of "declarations".  However, when
the tree is edited for incremental parse, the list is broken into two
sublists, rather than breaking down the entire list.

   The various EBNF repeats all produce optimized lists.

4 Language-specific parser runtime functions
********************************************

The parser has several hooks for language-specific functions:

'Language_Fixes'
     Called by error correction for each error (either the original
     error, or another encountered while checking a proposed solution);
     it should enqueue new solutions if it recognizes the error.

     For example, in Ada, compound statements like 'if then else end
     if;' or 'loop end loop;' have a matching keyword after the 'end'.
     So if the error is an incorrect keyword after 'end',
     'Language_Fixes' can recognize that, push back the 'end', and
     insert 'end <keyword>;'.

'Language_Matching_Begin_Tokens'
     Called by error correction for each proposed solution; it should
     return a token sequence to precede the current token.

     For example, in Ada, if the current token is 'end' and the next
     token is 'if', 'Language_Matching_Begin_Tokens' should return 'if'.

'Language_String_ID_Set'
     Called during language initialization; return a set of 'Token_ID'
     that can contain the given string literal ID. The set is then used
     by error correction when correcting missing string quotes.
