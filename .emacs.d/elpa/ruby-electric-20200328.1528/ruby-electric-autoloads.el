Toggle Ruby Electric minor mode.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.  Non-null prefix
argument turns on the mode.  Null prefix argument turns off the
mode.

If called interactively, toggle `Ruby-Electric mode'.  If the
prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero
or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

When Ruby Electric mode is enabled, an indented 'end' is
heuristicaly inserted whenever typing a word like 'module',
'class', 'def', 'if', 'unless', 'case', 'until', 'for', 'begin',
'do' followed by a space.  Single, double and back quotes as well
as braces are paired auto-magically.  Expansion does not occur
inside comments and strings. Note that you must have Font Lock
enabled.
