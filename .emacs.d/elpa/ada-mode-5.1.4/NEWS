* Ada mode 5.1.4
26 May 2014

** support expression functions

** beginning-of-defun-function, end-of-defun-function are now set. A
   "defun" is a generic, package, protected, subprogram, or task spec
   or body.

** C-c C-s is now bound to ada-goto-previous-pos, which goes to the
   first position in ada-goto-pos-ring. Most navigation functions set
   ada-goto-pos-ring. This allows easy navigation back to the start of
   a cross-reference chain.

** xref tool error handlers no longer show the xref tool buffer; the
   new Ada menu item 'show xref tool buffer' can be used instead.

** The parser supports more deeply nested case statements.

* Ada mode 5.1.3
19 Apr 2014

** more GNAT error message auto-fixes

** support aspects on subprogram declarations; format same as SPARK examples.

** fix bug in ada-syntax-propertize that caused query-replace to screw up

** inhibit reparse due to case adjust; case adjust entire buffer is
   now _much_ faster.

** Non-ASCII characters supported in Ada mode buffers, including GNAT
   bracket notation.

* Ada mode 5.1.2
16 Mar 2014

** fix another packaging bug; forgot to add files to ELPA git!

* Ada mode 5.1.1
14 Mar 2014

** require wisi-1.0.2, to fix packaging bug

** gnat-find now called with -a to include read-only .ali files in the results.

* Ada mode 5.1.0
13 Mar 2014

** Emacs 24.2 supported, via cl-lib in Gnu ELPA

** Better handling of aspects.

** 'record' is aligned with 'type' in derived types

** Several minor indentation bugs have been fixed.

** Added "2.2 Upgrading from previous versions" to the user guide.

** ada-align now properly handles subprograms with the opening paren
   on the same line as the preceding code and code on the same line as
   the closing paren:

    function Foo (Param_1 : Integer;
                  Param_2 : Integer) return Integer;

** When no project file is selected, the default variables are
   consistently used instead. Previously, the default variables were
   only used when parsing a project file.

** info files are properly visible in main info menu

** 'C-c ;' used to run `comment-dim', which is bound to 'M-;' in the
   global keymap. 'C-c ;' now gives an error with a message saying
   'use M-; instead'.

* Ada mode 5.0.1
Feb 2 2014

First public release, via ELPA

* Ada mode 5.0.0
Dec 24 2013

** first release in ELPA

** Previous version was 4.00, in Emacs core. 5.0.1 is a complete
   rewrite, using a generalized LALR parser that caches syntactic
   information in text properties.
