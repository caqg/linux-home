DRAFT FOR LAWRENCE'S EYES ONLY



# Executive Summary

This is a review of the build system task I commissioned in late September
2015, evaluated as of early March 2016. It covers my understanding of the
achievements and shortcomings of the offered deliverables, and some lessons
learned. It concludes with my expectations of how we will move
forward. Factual corrections and other feedback are very welcome.

My assessment of the task *at* *this* *point* is that the main goals were met,
at least partially (see below)--we could work from that basis on. However, the
proffered deliverables reach beyond the scope of the instrumental changes
required, to changing the architecture and the developer's UI of the build
system--the new system, aside its real merits, is a regression from the one we
had before, as we lost functionality we had, without compensation.

My diagnostic is that my informal statement of the original requirements is to
blame for inviting a serious excursion; I am disappointed in myself for not
writing a document like this at the beginning. I am also disappointed that the
_consequences_ of the massive changes implemented were not modeled and
discussed in review, and I am disappointed that my concerns have been ignored
in the implementation, in spite of having raised them early and often. 

I can't help but observe that tiring me into accepting an imposition that
harms innergy will not work. I am still responsible for leading our
Engineering efforts. I own the consequences of delegating this task.

The customer is the only judge of the quality of the product; if the customer
rejects a change and cannot be convinced otherwise, the correct thing to do is
to implement what the customer wants, and perhaps make a proposal to extend
the original scope later. In this task, I am the customer, and I have not
accepted the deliverable. I have reviewed the justifications, and I am not
convinced that all of this was needed to accomplish the objective. If we get
to that, it is my call, and it is no.


# Background

The task under review was designed to welcome Lawrence to our source
code. Thus, it addressed problems that were not urgent, but could eventually
become urgent. The actual deliverable (expected to be very light) was less
important than enabling Lawrence to examine the code and use the demo
software.

Naturally, it was expected that this would lead to his proposing deeper
changes for productivity and quality, and that was mentioned in
conversation. We study something, then we improve on it. Conversely, we can't
pretend to improve what we don't understand. I was looking forward
to thoughtful proposals. I didn't expect to be blindsided.


## Technical deliverables

Two weaknesses of our environment at the time were that (1) the build system
built on-tree, (2) we had no regression testing framework. Worse, of course,
we had no tests of any scale: unit, functional, regression, performance. 


Therefore, the two deliverables I requested were:

D1. Modify the build system to enable off-tree builds.

D2. Evaluate a regression testing scheme.

D0. Implicit in all requirements is the one to do no harm: I expect
that the above deliverables can be produced without losing existing
functionality, or that unavoidable tradeoffs will be presented for my choice
with a cost-benefit analysis.


## Criticism of the informal specification

I failed to write down in detail all the requirements and relevant business
constraints, in the wishful thought that Lawrence and I would shape together
this mini-project.

The objective D1 is actually ambiguous in two ways: 

  *  Did I mean the developer's build system, or some other build system (the
release management build system, the continuous integration build
system...). 

  *  What did I mean by "off tree". 
  
The objective D2 is open-ended. On the other hand, we had nothing, so a
narrowing of choices had to be a win, at some price.

  
### What build system?

I had in mind the developer's build system, the only one we had at the
time. The one I and others use a dozen times a day. Perhaps circumscribing the
task to that goal would have kept it focused.

It was possible to interpret this requirement in the sense of unattended
builds, as Release Management would need eventually. I have come to accept
that automated builds need to run on pre-configured machines--good, but 
irrelevant to the developer's system.

If our old build system had been studied before committing to changing it, it
would have been discovered that

  * Our makefiles built our product correctly (in the clean and the
    incremental senses),
    
  * Our makefiles confined the Verific makefiles, but did not try to replace
    them. There are good reasons for this: we are still using an eval, not
    their product, and we don't control when that will change.
    
  * Our makefiles observed the custom that `make` invoked at the top built the
    entire product (but not the externals).
    
  * Our makefiles supported an extensive range of source navigation tagging
    mechanisms: EDE, Exuberant Ctags, Emacs Ctags, GNU Global, CScope. That
    had required at some removing symbolic links from the repo and build areas
    (those links were a crude file sharing mechanism), to
    avoid limitations like not being able to decide which of two identically
    named files is the right one to jump to.
    
  * Builds made by our tools supported the GNU debugging tools and profilign
    correctly. The DWARF information pointed back to repo-based sources, not
    to build artifacts.
    
We'll see below that all of these features of the old system were broken by the
new one, with no value compensating for that unapproved cost.


### What is Off-Tree Building?

The minimal requirement (not to write back to the sources during the build)
has been accomplished. This is a reasonable interpretation of building
off-tree. I consider this an acceptable partial deliverable.

I should have pointed out the build systems of the Linux Kernel and GNU Emacs
as examples of what I wanted: a build system that lets me designate an
ordinary directory, unrelated to the one where the sources are, and have the
built objects created there.

For instance, I frequently (daily) build GNU Emacs 25 and the master branch
(which eventually will become Emacs 26). Git allows me to check both branches
out simultaneously to working directories that point to the same GIT\_DIR, and
then do the builds on directories that may be unrelated among themselves and
to the GIT\_DIR.

> In my current setup, the two working trees are at `/work/emacs/emacs-25` and

One use case for this ability is that you can cross-mount a repo, so the
sources you are testing are remote, but the build is local. A single repo can
feed builds for several operating systems and configurations. Another use case
is to keep the checked-out sources protected by an automated backup--the build
areas don't have to be backed up.

I may be wrong, but the delivered makefiles make fixed directory choices
(currently, in-tree but off-repo). If I am right, this can be fixed easily. Or
maybe the full off-tree functionality is there already. It is bad that I can't
figure it out without going to read the makefiles, but I am not sure what that
means.


# Analysis of the deliverables

D1 is at least partly done. It may be fully done, but I can't check for it.

D2 is done, if `make test` does what I think it does. 

The offered code reflects an interest in doing correct builds, and extends
that attitude to doing incremental unit (or sanity) testing. An avowed
characteristic is a concern with shortening the developer's cycle. Having
persistent test results is justified by supporting this goal and not costing
elsewhere. That all the task had been driven by this attitude!

Regrettably, the deliverables undo their good wishes by being extraordinarily
Baroque. The new build system goes over board with changes either gratuituous
(pure cost with no benefit) or harmful (negative utility even if we could
avoid paying their cost).

In addition, the goal of imposing one's requirements on external builds is not
a good choice. The externals are black boxes from our perspective. There is no
way to amortize the cost of trying to handle the externals.

The following subsections mention the already-known problems with the
over-reaching makefiles. For all of them, one could ask "who in innergy had
this problem, who is now happy it is fixed", and "how much did it cost to fix
this instead of working on the product". And also "why is this still in the
code".


## Host configuration and Build on the same tool
 
One could argue from ideological principles that combining unrelated functions
only makes them brittle. I dislike (see below) invoking principles against
principles, but I don't need to do that: the current system breaks, and cannot
be fixed because it tries to do something it has not enough data for, namely
prequalify the host machine for the build.

A bad consequence is that the build fails in an attempt to check the package
configuration in a ***qualified*** machine (as in, *it was doing builds fine just
now*).
I have had to work around a complaint about libreadline-dev from
a clean build. I am very irritated that the evidence that this hack does not
work has not been enough to stop the argument. Worse off, the alleged check
may "succeed" when it has no effect: if I have installed (say) my own CLANG
somewhere, I don't need GCC. Installing it just wastes my life. The build
system just needs to build and not try to second guess me. Retesting this,
even if to check for the existence of a witness file, is unjustified.

It may have been OK to separate the prequalification (needed **at** **most**
**once** on a new Ubuntu machine) from the build (run many times a day). This
option was offered, and was rejected on ideological grounds, so I don't feel like
letting the offer stand. The check for packages must go, this is past
non-negotiable.

It is true that in a BYOC situation we may have competent people who are not
skilled in maintaining an Ubuntu development system. It is also true that
automated build machines need to be configured automatically, or at least
unattended. If this had been brought to attention it would have had to be
considered, and I agree now that a solution is needed. I could have indicated
the best known methods.

Instead, Lawrence decided to implement from scratch a non-solution. This
feature of the new build system is a reinvention of the flat tire. Attempting
it is excusable, insisting after the objections were clear borders on
malpractice.


## Trying to build everything, not just the product

The charming feature of trying to build all the externals before a clean build
can start is completely unnecessary, and prone to failures that should never
be allowed to stop developer builds. Again, studying the system being
superseded would have pointed this out. Asking would have worked too, except
that when I directed that the externals not be built I was ignored again.

As a consequence, we have no place in the directory tree where we can run a
full product build cleanly, without waiting for the current system to fail on
the externals. Working around by separately building `verific` and `compass`
(that rename, by the way, is another gratuituous contribution) is a regression
from the previous setup.


## Separating the sources into several repos

Dispersing the sources does not help with correctness, off-tree capability, or
regression testing. Assuming there is something to gain, it is not related to
the task at hand.

On first blush it does not seem like a bad idea. For instance, this could be
used to streamline developer builds: clone and build only the product, until
such a time when you need an external built.

Regrettably, that wasn't the intention. The new makefiles try to build
everything (see above), so there is no good explanation for this change.

Does this separation have a cost?

Of course; experience with the new system has already shown some reasons why
we were better off keeping everything (even the externals) in one directory in
one repository.

  * The first one is that the top of the source tree is not in a repo. Make no
    mistake, there is still a top directory (`/work/innergy`), it is just not
    that useful, What we lost is the ability to say `git clone; cd TOP; make`.
    This can be alleviated by teaching the top makefile how to pull or
    fetch, as has been done. It would not have been needed in a single repo.
    
  * When you can't use the top makefile because it tries to change your
    machine's configuration, you are limited to the workaround of pulling
    every repo that is part of the product (2 or 3 today). Doing that is
    annoying because you may forget one, and becauase you can't just `cd
    compass; git pull` anymore. You have to remember the also unjustified
    existence of the `repo/` subdirectories.
    
This also means that the top makefile must know about cloning repos--yet
another accidentally cohesive function added to the build, but not as
objectionable as the others (because it hasn't failed yet).

I don't recall any Engineering organization that employed me where our sources
didn't live in one repository, whose check-out enabled the build system. There
may be a reason.


### lnk/ directories

I did not like this feature because I could not understand the cost-benefit
analysis, and said so. Then I remembered that it screws up the debugging
information, and got the impression that we had agreed to remove them (they
are never needed to build, whatever else they may be needed for). Of course,
that was just my imagination.

After the fact I have found that this gratuituous feature forces work on the
tagging scripts. Why were tags sacrificed to having redundant symbolic links?
If the tags feature had been kept it would have given us another reason not to
do this.

This must go.


## Changes to the developer UI to the build system

In this area I am happy to acknowledge that I haven't faced the same
unreasonable resistance as in the others. I hesitated between leaving it here
and moving it to the next section; my decision to keep it here is to emphasize
that one doesn't go breaking muscle interfaces casually.

When in doubt, there are ways to avoid imposing what amounts to personal taste
on others.


### Plain `make` should make

Whatever best intentions may recommend otherwise, `make` makes, does not
complain for the lack of a target. It runs the default target, which builds
the product in some usable way. There is nothing unspecific about it.

I am happy to acknowledge that Lawrence agreed to do this, with a suggestion
to run `make check` as the default target. I am OK if there is another target
(say `make build`) that just builds--there are many occasions when we are just
checking syntax, or want to check an intermediate state that should fail some
of its tests, but illuminate something else. 

Of course, we don't push those intermediates to the automated builds, but
being forced to check always only encourages finding a way around. At any
rate, this is as good as it gets, but we should keep an eye on regressions that try
to change what every user of `make` expects. And, anyway, the install targets
require a check before they run. (I wonder if this insistence in checking is not
going to come back and hurt us at some point, but I have no non-hypothetical
bad consequences to worrry about.)

#### Other targets must follow suit

For instance, `make pull` should descend to the product repos only. Any action
on the externals requires invoking a target with the externals name. Better
yet, the top make does not have any targets that descenc into the externals
for anything other than running their makes.


### The basic targets are spelled runtogether or dash-separated

I am surprised that Lawrence was not aware of the convention. If you tell some
one to type "make clean soul", they will go "$ make cleansoul"; if you say
"make install elsewhere", they will go "$ make install-elsewhere". Changing
the dash to underscore for the sake of asserting one's individuality is not good
Engineering. This should have been acted upon as soon as I reported
it. Instead, having gotten tired to mistyping, I had to add the trivial fix
that makes both spelling acceptable. (All because the willingness to ignore my
concerns was enough to prevent a one-line change.)

The underlying reasoning is that these trivial shows of individuality do the
expected: attract attention to themselves. Now, that is a great way to win a
design review: someone will notice the underscore and not the real problems.

I will demand a change on this, but mostly in documentation.


## Lesser questionable features

I will maintain here a list of minor inconveniences or misfeatures I would
have blocked if I had had the option to review the design before work was
spent. These need not go immediately--instead, we should keep an eye on them
and move to better solutions IF the need really arises. Let's say that these
are problems-not-worth-fixing, a very important category in my Engineering
thought.


### inc/ directories

The ostensible goal is to be explicit about what header files are intended as
interfaces used by others. That goal does not imply that the header files must
be separated from their sources! It is a common mistake (e.g., Robert and Guru
started us that way because that's what they did before, and it stayed in place
until it became a problem. I fixed a similar issue at my client's a couple
years ago. VisualStudio sort of encourages this.)

The cost of this separation is minimal if sources and headers are at a fixed
relative location (as in `src/x.cc` and `include/x.hh`, or the
just-had-to-be-different `repo/x.c` and `inc/x.h`), A developer always knows where
to find The Other file: it is either a sibling of the source file, or a cousin
somewhere under an `inc/`.

How much easier it is to find a sibling of the file in the very same
directory... But if segregating the exported headers accomplished *something*,
it may be worth the smallish cost.

Now, it takes only a second to realize that even that minimal consequence can
be avoided: the way to be explicit to a build system is to say it in
`make`. The last version of our older build system had an empty include/
because the leaf makefiles started their action by populating (or updating)
the contents of that directory with their exported headers.

In a system that builds the makefiles automatically, it is enough to have a
file (say) `exported-headwrs.mk` in each component source directory, with a
single line

> EXPORTED_HEADERS=PvPaProtocol.hpp

The boilerplate files simply

> -include exported-headers.mk

I can't imagine many good reasons to fix this, but I should say I would have
indicated the cleaner solution instead during design review. Not that anyone
asked.

# Lessons Learned

Ideas are welcome, as I hope I am not the only one doing the learning.

## The First-Day session is not optional

This was my mistake. No one should be able to opt out of building the system
under another engineer's supervision, and then run the demo (minimally) during
their First Day. Nothing is more important. It doesn't matter how well
documented our practices may become, this is the only contact an engineer
should ever require, and it is not optional.

## Write down requirements

Even among respected colleagues, informal specs invite accidents. For now I
intend to use the issues mechanism, without overdoing the detail.

## Establish a culture of no-surprises

Leaving an expert free to run is desirable. When I get a task delegated to me,
I try to make it disappear from my customer's mind. This means that my
customer knows that the problem is as good as solved without breaking anything
else, or that I will get back to them if I shouldn't resolve a tradeoff
on my own. So my bosses let me run free--they don't expect frequent reports,
but they expect I won't surprise them by doing something they would like to
know about before I do it.

**No amount of design and code review will succeed if we don't commit to not
surprising one another.** Let's work on this.

## There has to be a Decider

Not always the same, but every important decision has an owner. Mutual trust
means that we don't undermine the decider by arguing endlessly--we disagree
and commit, or we resign. No company survives that is arguing all the time.

## Argue Consequences, not Principles

Arguing from Principles doesn't work. The other side can always recall or
invent a contrary Principle, and no progress is made. (TV gives frequent
examples these days; I am watching one as I write this.)

Engineering doesn't advance on Ideology, but on Results. We don't demand
perfection or certainty, but access to information of known quality.  We
suspect any demand of absolute certainty--when you are certain you are no
longer able to test if you are *right*.

I don't have to recall that every decision is a tradeoff, that all the actions
have an expected utility and cost, including the null action. With those
tools, we don't need no stinking principles to persuade one another.

In our start-up there is no end of work that needs to be done. Picking
problems for ourselves and for others (especially the junior ones) requires
asking not what Principle supports the decision, but what Consequences we are
facing. Events of low impact or probability can be ignored--we will debug them
if and when they happen. No work should be done on behalf of some abstract
ideal.

So is there room for Principles in Engineering? Surely for ethical principles,
but what else? Principles are implementation hints (do not combine apt and
make because accidental cohesion is brittle, do not use magic numbers if they
can be named, do not depart from what your users expect unless it buys you
something, do not test for a condition you don't know how to handle...). They
help us pick between solutions to a problem, but that works only if we picked
good problems, worth solving, worth solving now, worth solving by us instead
of outsourced. If we pick the wrong problem, no amount of ideology will keep
us on track.

## Keep all your sources in a single repository

I am surprised how quickly this one went bad--I would have sworn that it
didn't matter, and might even be useful. I had thought of getting the
Externals out myself.

Now I know good reasons for not separating what belongs together, any more
than putting together what should be apart.

## Occam's razor

This is a lesson I already learned--I just couldn't apply it because I never
reviewed the plan. I would have queried Lawrence about why repo/ and inc/ and
all the other novelties were needed. The right thing was to implement what was
needed (none of the above) and see what else may be needed later. Multiplying
unwarranted names and entities is hard to undo, but easy to avoid.

Also, anything that falls to the Razor was not a solid thing to work on. So,
no biggie--it is not like the World missed the last change to misspell
"lnk". There are better things to do, and clearing these trivia will enable us
to tackle them.


## Imitate the cats

It is not what one says, but how one says it. (Cats are famous for making do
with two sounds, richly modulated.)

When offering a solution for a problem (assuning it is a Good Problem), it is
better to present the benefits of what the new work will *enable*, not what it
will *prevent*. Lawrence should practice looking for the feature allowed, not
for the bug avoided (especially if the bug is trivial to fix or imaginary).

My own reaction to proposals that aim at certainty in safety is to discount
them to zero present value--then any cost kills them. We have too many good
things to achieve that we should not spend any time punishing the guilty or
worrying about asteroid collisions. Or imagining that absolute safety is possible
at a sane cost. Life is an assumed-risk activity.


# The way forward

The goal still remains to hand over the Engineering leadership to Lawrence;
the miscommunication in this episode is just that. Therefore, Lawrence must
get visibly important development goals, and people to lead; the only proviso
is that a commitment is needed from his part to work as an Engineering leader:
by cultivating among the team a culture of identifying the customer and
refraining from arguing with that customer, of picking problems to solve
exclusively in terms of the consequences for innergy of solving (or not
solving) them, and of not surprising one's colleagues.

Soon Lawrence will have to be able to say to others "I heard you, we have
discussed it, but it is my call". No better way to get him ready than for him
that to practice the Disagree But Commit strategy in this project.

In any case, we need to be done with the build system project quickly. This
may leave some work for later or never, so let's do what is absolutely
necessary first, and move on to other things. I for one never expected to
invest so much time arguing about a trivial upgrade.


## Absolute requirements

I must not lose any build functionality.

Once the below actions are complete I will provide the implementation of
tagging and that will be the cherry on top. We will have most of the previous
functionality plus the two new features, plus the bonuses (test persistence,
others?).

***The meeting in person must not leave any doubts that this is the plan of
record, and that it will be implemented with great haste.***

### Discard all the code that tries to test or enforce a package list

There is a way explained below to take care of the once-only needs of BYOC contributors.

### No link directories

The build objects are to depend on the source files under source control, and
possibly on relocated or generated files, never on links, even hard.

### Make at the top just builds the product

The top is `/work/innergy` or its alternative locations. The product 
today is `verific/` and `compass/`. It is OK to leave `algochips/` out
for now; we can revise this later.

It is OK to keep `check` as the default target, but the `build` target must exist,
and not do anything but run the build.


### Making the externals is optional and explicit

For instance, to get `systemc/` built, one does `cd systemc; make install-local`. No target
builds any externals implicitly. That is how it worked before, so this just
restores sanity.


### Document the dash-separated targets

The synonyms may stay if this is an issue of muscle-memory. They may not be
documented or (much less) recommended. We will stop attracting attention to
our tastes.


### Document the apt-clone strategy

After a new user has cloned `ecosystem/`, he or she should be able to initiate a
restore.  We can declare victory by indicating where the clones are and how to
restore them. I have code that identifies which clone is needed (from the
release identification data, not from sniffing packages), but just explaining
what to do is enough.

The build system should not offer any automation of this. None. Ever.

I will mail Lawrence a copy of the currently known-good clone for 15.10 as
soon as we get his commitmment.


## Under review

These actions are not needed to declare victory and move on now. They can be
treated as a fill-in priority (which means we may never get around to doing them).


### Off-Tree build completion

Confirm that the build areas can be disconnected from the source areas
already, or else provide a high-level plan for how we could do this later. No
need to actually implement it, but let's make sure we understand how much
notice in advance of the need we will require. The alternative is to port the
build to a mechanism that is known to do this, like the autotools. That bounds
the acceptable effort.


### Replace the inc/ dirs with a make feature

As explained above, `inc/` was never needed (and should have been called
`include/` if it was needed). Removing this is one fewer distraction.

However, removing a distraction is not valuable enough to schedule it
now. Maybe we will have to live forever with this inelegant mar in our
polish--living with it may be a good way to remind us that we don't need
perfection.


### Flatten the components

When there is no `inc/`, `repo/` should go. Make each component host its
own .git (or whatever we are using at the time). This will return the ability
to `cd compass; git pull; make` without distracting extra entities. As this
depends on something we may never do, it is in limbo too. Amazingly, it would
just restore what was working when this task started.


# Conclusion

This task has taken an inordinate amount of effort from all the involved,
which included Cameron and Sameer at some points. I assume responsibility for
not stopping the waste before, and I have provided here a workable plan to get
done with this task at limited losses. If we get together behind this plan we
may be able to make the episode a plus instead of the runaway minus it has
become.
