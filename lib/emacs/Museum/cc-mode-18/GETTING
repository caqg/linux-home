Getting cc-mode.el
===================
The latest public release version of this file should always be
available for anonymous ftp on the Emacs Lisp Archive machine.  The

archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/modes/cc-mode.tar.Z

This file contains the .el source code and a README file.

For those of you without anon-ftp access, you can use the DEC

cc-mode:

connect archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
binary
uuencode
chdir pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/modes
get cc-mode.tar.Z

or just send the message "help" for more information on ftpmail.
Response times will vary with the number of requests in the queue.
