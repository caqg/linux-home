Experiences in dumping Emacs with cc-mode:

    Do this:

    % cd <wherever_c_mode.el_is>
    % mv c-mode.el c-mode.el.bak
    % mv cc-mode.el c-mode.el

    Then byte-compile c-mode.el to produce c-mode.elc

    In both FSF 19.22 and Lucid 19.9 version.el is loaded too late in
    the loadup.el file.  cc-mode.el depends on the value of
    emacs-version so you need to move the load of version.el higher up
    in the file.

    You may need to crank up PURESIZE in src/pursize.h.  I found I had
    to add about 14k, but of course YMMV.

    Tell your users not to add the f/makunbound's or autoloads to
    their .emacs files, since they'll now get cc-mode for free.

    In Lucid 19.9, loaddefs.el contains a lot of automatically
    generated autoload definitions which will cause warnings when it
    finds pointers to doc strings.  You can either ignore these
    warnings (they won't hurt you), or you can comment out the
    autoloads for c++-mode and c-style.  Or you can regenerate the
    automatic autoloads once you've moved c++-mode.el and c-mode.el
    aside, but you'll have to figure this part out by yourself.

    I've also been told that under FSF Emacs 19, you have to get rid
    of the autoloads for cplus-md*.el since c++-mode.el has been
    renamed. You should also do an update-directory-autoloads on the
    lisp directory before you redump.
