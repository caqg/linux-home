README for cc-mode
Barry A. Warsaw <cc-mode-help@python.org>

Please see to comments at the top of the cc-mode.el file, or read the
cc-mode.texinfo manual, for details on using cc-mode.

Preformatted versions of the manual in DVI, PostScript, and Info, are
all available at <http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/>.

To build the manual yourself, you will need the latest Texinfo release
(currently Texinfo 3.9).  Specifically, you must make sure that your
are using at least version 2.185 of the texinfo.tex file.  To build
the Info manual, simply type:

    % makeinfo cc-mode.texi

To make the DVI version, simply type:

    % texi2dvi cc-mode.texi

The MANIFEST file contains a description of all the files you should
have gotten with this distribution.
